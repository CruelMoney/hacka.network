# How to Start a New HackaNetwork Chapter Node

Starting a new HackaNetwork chapter node is a great way to bring together indie-makers, developers, and creators in your area. But we would like you to follow some guidelines.

Follow the steps below to establish your own community hub.

## 1. The HackaNetwork Spirit

First, dive into the Hackafesto (our manifesto). Our community is very much tech-first and all about building apps, products and startups. Coding your own product or app is at the heart of what we do. There is always a place for other things that are part of it all, such as marketing, sales, etc, our core is in development and coding. 
Regarding the rhythm/schedule in the hackafesto: feel free to adapt the schedule to best fit your chapter's needs, but please keep the individual components intact. They are the essence of HackaNetwork and a proven concept :)

## 2. Connect with HackaNetwork:

If you like what you read in the hackafesto, the next step is to reach out to us HackaNetwork organizers to assist with setting up your Telegram group, chapter website, and any other resources you might need. 
We're here to help you and ensure you have the necessary support for a successful chapter launch!

## 3. Choose a Suitable Venue

Securing a good location is essential. A co-working space or office are amongst the best locations. You all will be working throughout the day you wouldn't want to be distracted, right? 
We advise to avoid highly public places to maintain a focused environment. The venue should support collaborative working and be able to faciliate the introuctions, lunch and demos.

In particular for the demos, it's key to have a projector/screen or large TV and necessary cables and equipment for members to give demos. Meeting rooms are generally good for this.
Make sure that it's also sufficiently big so everyone fits (we have first-hand experience with this challenge, that's why we mention it here ;))

## 4. Establish Your Chapter's Presence

Create a dedicated website for your chapter using the provided template (we let you know how to when you contact us, which, at this stage, you've already done).

Keep public/online promotion minimal to maintain the chapter's culture and values (again, we have experience with this, it's the best approach generally). Carefully considering these will help to grow slow, stable and steadily and will help you with sticking to our hackafesto. 
It's best to invite people 1-on-1 if you feel like they're a good fit. Public promotions should be rare and carefully considered to maintain our culture. 

During step 2 we'll also explain this, but we need you to establish a Telegram group to facilitate communication within your community. This is one of the most essential parts.

## 5. Set a Consistent Schedule

Plan your chapter's weekly Thursday meetups with morning introductions, an informal lunch, afternoon demos, and optional evening activities. 
Consistency helps build a reliable community rhythm, so it's best to decide beforehand and stick to your own schedule/timing.

## 6. Host the First Meetup

First of all, have fun! In the mornings, start with introductions and encourage members to not just introduce themselves, but also share about their companies, projects and goals. 
Prepare the afternoon demo session to ensure everything is ready to go and facilitate it by asking who has a demo at first, setting a maximum time (we suggest 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the amount of demos), and ask who wants to go first. It'll sort itself out afterwards :)!

## 7. Commit to Long-Term Organization

Dedicate yourself to the ongoing management of your chapter, by making sure both the venue and weekly meetups are consistently organized. 
As the chapter grows, you'll notice it will naturally begin to self-organize :)!

By following these steps, you can successfully launch a HackaNetwork chapter node, creating a vibrant community of innovators and independent creators in your area. Hurray! Welcome to the HackaNetwork family!
